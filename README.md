BACK END CODE
-------------
               Host.py

This was the server for our chat room.
Used modules: Socket, Threading, Time
Utilized object oriented programming to seamlessly use common variables between functions.
Used a password to authenticate incomming connections. If the password is incorrect the client is appropriately dealt with.
Cleaned up the way that the Host handles sudden disconnections. 
Created commands such as $help, $terminate and $name.


Front END CODE
--------------

              Interface.py
Used Tinkter to build the GUI (Compliments to Jacob)
Used Lambda to bind buttons to certain actions
Implemented images and ORIGINAL MUSIC into the GUI 
Music made by Jacob

CONNECTING BOTH ENDS
-----------------

		 Client.py
Used object orriented programming to link the enormous amount of variables and attributes between functions. 
Brought over the code from the Terminal version of the client and adjusted it to connect with the GUI. This was incredibly difficult, but possible thanks to Nana and Jacob.

EXTRA
-----

 		Port.py
Built a small program to find ports on a network that are open to port forwarding.
