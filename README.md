# Final_Project
 Hemanth Kamana, Nana Korsah, Jacob Tamrat

Our project will be a chat room. We will explore networking in python and we have plans of even creating a password to enter the chat room. Creating a password for the chat room will be tricky because the password can't be stored in the project files. We will be using online resources to learn about the socket module and to develop a rudimentary knowledge of networking computers.
